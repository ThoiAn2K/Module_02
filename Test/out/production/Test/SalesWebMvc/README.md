# SalesWebMvc

Hello World

This is my first project using ASP.NET Core MVC.
It was a new experience, but very interesting.

The project is based on a store environment that contains departments, products, sellers and sales. It is possible to make a complete crud in the sellers, departments and products.

In sales it is possible to add a new sale and see the sales that have already occurred, being possible how much money was earned in each sale and how much each department sold.

I hope you like the project.
